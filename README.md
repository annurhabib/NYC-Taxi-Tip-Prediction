Dataset Overview

This dataset provides a thorough overview of New York City taxi trip records, highlighting several facets of urban mobility via the perspective of yellow cab services. To provide insights into fare dynamics and urban transportation trends, the dataset is made available under the TPEP/LPEP projects.
